To use drag and drop the folders into the root directory

This example has a decompiled and semi-reversed 'gbuffer_lit' pixel and vertex shader. It should behave the exact same as the normal 'gbuffer_lit' shaders. After installing you should find the material/texture called 'example_material' in both APE and Radiant.
More documentation is a WIP
