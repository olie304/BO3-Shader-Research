To use drag and drop the folders into the root directory

NOTE: This shader will only work on static brushes and patches! It will break on any kind of model or other special surfaces!

I made this shader to be a 1:1 of the actual Minecraft end portal shader. I ported the LWGJL code to HLSL for Unity and then ported that to Black ops 3. This example will also be packaged with Sphynx's Minecraft asset pack, but I will keep a reference version in this repo. Included are shaders, techsets, materials and prefabs. To use the pre-made prefabs at 1:1 Minecraft scale just install and find it in Radiant. Otherwise apply the material 'end_portal_mat' to whatever brush or patch you want. In APE the technique is under 'Specialty' as 'End Portal' if you desire further customization. Currently there are slight variations in color and scale which make this BO3 version not entirely 1:1 but, it is very close.
